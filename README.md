This repository contains sample IoT sensor applications that were developed during IoThon 3.0. 
The goal of these applications is to demonstrate how to collect, process, and
act on data from various sensors like temperature, motion, and environmental sensors.
These examples provide a basic understanding of how IoT devices communicate and interact in real-world environments.
