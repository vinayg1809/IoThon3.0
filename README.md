This repository contains sample IoT sensor applications that were developed for IoThon 3.0. 
The goal of these applications is to demonstrate basic working of a few environmental sensors.
These examples provide a basic understanding of how IoT devices communicate and interact in real-world environments.

imp-> go to "Library Manager" and install "Adafruit MPU6050" -> this is for Accmtr and gyroscope

1ST code -> Basic LED blinking
2ND code -> Basic thermostat working
3RD code -> Basic accelerometer and gyroscope using a new library
